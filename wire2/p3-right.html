    <p><strong>Anna (Student): </strong>First of all, l don't  be scared to start and then when material come through the door, just take it  with a cool head and don't panic, as I did.</p>

    <p><strong>Agron (Student)</strong>: You need to be  proactive,&nbsp;in as much as you can,&nbsp; in trying to participate. </p>
    <p><strong>Alexa (Student):</strong> Attend as many  tutorials as possible, as they help a lot. You get to meet a lot of people. </p>
    <p><strong>Agron (Student):</strong> Get yourself used to  asking for help basically. </p>

    <p><strong>Mongrou (Student)</strong>: There are tutor that  very helpful and some student who are very helpful too, so keep in touch.</p>
    <p><strong>Anna (Student)</strong>: Never be afraid to  ask for help, either from other students or from tutors, because they will be  always willing to help.</p>
    <p><strong>Kafula (Student)</strong>: Find people within  your course that you can talk to, but also to use the comments from the tutors. </p>
    <p><strong>Aneta (Student)</strong>: Even if people doubt  themselves, there is so much encouragement from the tutor, from fellow  students, from everyone actually involved in a course, and everyone is trying  to make the entire process easier.</p>
    <p><strong>Mongrou (Student)</strong>: The language part was  quite difficult for me. I often said <q>"oh this is so difficult I wish I can  understand it"</q>. My daughter said, <q>"No one asked you to do it, why  don't you just give up?"</q> But I said to her, <q>"No, I will not because  that is something I want to do and I will not give up"</q>. </p>

    <p><strong>Emma (Learning Advisor)</strong>:   If I could pass on just one study tip to a new student it would be to get organised. </p>
    <p><strong>Jed</strong> <strong>(Student)</strong>:   Figure out as far ahead as you can, your schedule and where to fit things in. </p>
    <p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>(Student)</strong>:&nbsp;And prioritising is one of the major things that I feel most people who are studying should actually try and get into their heads.</p>

    <p><strong>James (Student)</strong>:&nbsp;Read through the material, and then go back to it with your highlighter which is the OU student's friend.</p>
    <p><strong>Mark (Tutor)</strong>:&nbsp;Write on your text books. It's a way to actually engage with the material.</p>
    <p><strong>Fran (Student)</strong>:&nbsp;And I know lots of other people on the courses sometimes go you scribbled in your book! You've got these beautiful books but it's OK. They're there to be used. It's much better if you colour them in.</p>
    <p><strong>Lynn (Student)</strong>:&nbsp;And I put little post-its all over the page and sticking out at the side.</p>

    <p><strong>Cynthia (Student)</strong>:&nbsp;I was writing my facts on them and I was sticking them down and then I could move them around.</p>
    <p><strong>Matthew (Student)</strong>:&nbsp;It's important to take a break every now and again and refresh your mind.</p>
    <p><strong>Ian (Student)</strong>:&nbsp;I find that exercise actually greatly helps to improve concentration.</p>
    <p><strong>Mel (Student)</strong>:&nbsp;For an exam or assignment question, the first thing I'd do is to read the question, then re-read the question - a tip from my dad.</p>

    <p><strong>Katherine (Student)</strong>:&nbsp;Breathe. I breathe when the exam starts.</p>
    <p><strong>Rachel</strong> <strong>(Student)</strong>:&nbsp;Just take your time and persevere with things and don't get too worried if you can't do something.</p>
    <p><strong>Lijing</strong> <strong>(Student)</strong>:&nbsp;You should make full use of the online resources.</p>

    <p><strong>Ruth (Associate Lecturer)</strong>:&nbsp;If they get the chance to go to tutorials they really should take that opportunity.</p>
    <p><strong>Derek (Student)</strong>:&nbsp;If in any doubt consult your tutor.</p>
    <p><strong>Robin</strong> <strong>(Student)</strong>:&nbsp;There's always somebody you can talk to.</p>

    <p><strong>Joanne (Student)</strong>:&nbsp;So if you need help, don't suffer alone. Ask.</p>
    <p><strong>Fran (Student)</strong>:&nbsp;The biggest advice I would give, for any of the Open University courses, is to try and find support systems. I know when I did DD100, I tried to plough on alone. Often if I was getting behind and there was a tutorial I felt that if I was behind I shouldn’t go, because I’d have to admit to everyone that I wasn’t really up to the point where everyone else was. I think that that disadvantaged me. This year I went along to the first tutorial and swapped numbers with a couple of people. And we keep in touch all the time. <q>“How are you doing? How are you getting on?”</q> And it really motivates me to keep going.</p>
    <p><strong>Cynthia</strong> <strong>(Student)</strong>:&nbsp;Planning is the best advice I’ve been given. Otherwise you just do go off at a tangent. So you have to keep the question in front of you. I write it on a little card and put it in front of me at all times. And that way I stay focused on it.</p>

    <p><strong>Robin (Student)</strong>:&nbsp;It’s a matter of actually making the time. If something’s important enough, you’ll find a way to do it. And certainly this is something that is very important to me. So I find the time.</p>
    <p><strong>Fran (Student)</strong>:&nbsp;I work as an Events and Training Co-ordinator for a Management Consultancy. Some of my colleagues work in psychology so I can pick their brains occasionally. And also if I’ve got a bit of time at the end of day, nobody has a problem if I want to do a little bit of reading. That’s not frowned upon, that’s OK.</p>
